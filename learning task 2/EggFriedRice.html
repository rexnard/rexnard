          <li>Chop the onion into bits, any size really, doesnt matter particularly and throw into the frying pan.</li>
          <li>Chop the mushrooms and add to the onions.</li>
          <li>Once the rice is cooked, drain it off and add it into the frying pan.</li>
          <li>Tip the drained sweetcorn into the pan as well and stir it all up.</li>
          <li>Break the eggs into the pan (OR beat them together in another bowl and tip into the frying pan) and stir the mixture up.</li>
