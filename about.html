                <h1>About Poverty</h1>
                <p1><li> Poverty is defined as a lack of access to basic necessities such as food, water, clothing, and shelter. It is one of our society's problems.
Rather, our country. Poverty affects people for a variety of causes, and it has a wide range of consequences.</li></p1>
 <p2><li> There are several significant reasons why our country is experiencing poverty. One of the causes of this problem is the presence of irresponsible leaders or government officials. The problem of graft and corruption exists because, despite the passage of time, there are still authorities who use their position and power to obtain cash and utilize them for their own personal gain rather than to meet the needs of residents and our country. However, it is not always our government's responsibility; civilians can sometimes make mistakes. It's what we call overpopulation. It’s a cause of poverty because some couple or families are not having a 
 proper family plan and nowadays, pregnancy happens at an early age that adds up to our population. The funds will not be enough 
 to all of us that’s why some people will not be given the things that they need. Another reason that leads to poverty is the lack 
 of opportunities for the people to work and have a higher salary.</li></p2>
          <p3> <li> Because there are constraints and high standards for employment, a significant portion of our population is unable to work. These
Nowadays, to be considered for a job, applicants must have completed college and have work experience. When they are not working, they perform menial tasks that do not pay well enough to meet their basic necessities. Finally, poverty is exacerbated by climate change. For me, it doesn’t affect all of the jobs but because there are so many hardworking farmers here in the Philippines that 
work for their family, climate change is a big problem for them. When dry season arrives, farmers are having a hard time growing their 
crops because their crops need enough amount of water to grow. When this happens, they will not produce products and will not earn money 
that they will use to buy the needed things of their family that will add to their problems in farming.</li></p3>
                <p4> <li> Poverty isn't only a squandered currency. It will have an impact not only on the residents, but on the entire country. Filipinos will, on the whole, have a positive outlook.
Surviving in such trying circumstances is difficult. Furthermore, many people will become ill as a result of their excessive hunger and lack of energy.
I'm going to work and won't be able to make enough money. When these things happen, our economy and country's progress will be slowed.</li></p4>
                <p5><li>Everyone wants to live a happy life, which is why poverty must be avoided. 
                    Every decision we make should be based on a strategy.
will require, particularly when starting a family. You should also set a positive example for those around you if you become a leader. You must consider your options. Not only your own, but also the needs of others. More work opportunities are needed in our country, as well as support for pay parity.
As a result, workers will receive a fair wage.</li></p5>
                <p6><li> As a result, we will be able to understand that poverty is one of the global crises that requires immediate attention. Poverty is the state of being poor. The inability to meet our basic necessities in order to live longer. It's a lethal issue that's steadily murdering our population, and it's one that we, as the government, must address. Those who are affected must take action and find answers.</li></p6>
